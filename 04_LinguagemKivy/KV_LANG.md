# KV LANG

Programming Guide

## Concept behind the language

As yout application grows more complex, it's common that the construction of widget trees and explicit declaration of binding becomes verbose and hard to maintain. The *KV* Language is an attempt to overcome these shortcomings.

The *KV* language, sometimes called kvlang or the kivy language, allows you to create your widget tree in a declarative way and to bind widget properties to each other or to callbacks in a natural manner. It allows for very fast prototypes and agile changes to your UI. It also facilitates separating the logic of yout application and its User Interface.

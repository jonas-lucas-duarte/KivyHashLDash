## App

The App class is the base for creating Kivy applications. Think o it as yout main entry point into the Kivy run loop. In most cases, you subclass this class and make your own app. You create an instance of yout specific app class and then, when you are ready to start the application's life cycle, you call yout instance's App.run() method.
